# IncCity 🏙️

A browser-based city-building incremental game where you start with a tiny 4-tile island and expand your territory, construct buildings, and grow your economy.

## 🎮 About the Project

IncCity is a minimalist city-building game that runs entirely in your browser. Beginning with just a small island of four squares, players gradually expand their territory, strategically place buildings, and manage their finances to create a thriving city. The game features custom 3D buildings and terrain built from scratch using Three.js.
